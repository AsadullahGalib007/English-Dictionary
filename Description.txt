##The project was done by self interest. It is not a part of my University Syllabus##

Description:
# This is an English to English dictionary
# The dictionary program is written in Python
# I have collected the words from different sources (Word collections are in json form)
# Errors are handled properly (The program won't crash, hope so)

Advantages:
# Search by typing word
# Search by voice search
# Get suggestion for misspelled words

Limitations:
# The collection of words (json files) are quite outdated
# Voice search only works with active internet connection
# No GUI is available(You have to run the program in terminal)
# In noisy place voice search feature may not work properly

How to run the program? :
# Requirements:
        #install packages such as pip, pyaudio,speech recognition module
                  1. sudo apt install python-pip
                  2. sudo pip install SpeechRecognition
                  3. sudo apt install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio
                  4. sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python-all-dev python3-all-dev && sudo pip install pyaudio
# Run the program:
        1. python2 Dictionary_App.py


Future plan :
# Making the program robust and an eye-catching GUI
# Updating the word collection
