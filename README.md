# English-Dictionary

##The project was done by self interest. It is not a part of my University Syllabus##

# Description:
1. This is an English to English dictionary
2. The dictionary program is written in Python
3. I have collected the words from different sources (Word collections are in json form)
4. Errors are handled properly (The program won't crash, hope so)

# Advantages:
1. Search by typing word
2. Search by voice search
3. Get suggestion for misspelled words

# Limitations:
1. The collection of words (json files) are quite outdated
2. Voice search only works with active internet connection
3. No GUI is available(You have to run the program in terminal)
4. In noisy place voice search feature may not work properly

# How to run the program? :
Requirements:
Install packages such as pip, pyaudio,speech recognition module
         1. sudo apt install python-pip
         2. sudo pip install SpeechRecognition
         3. sudo apt install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio
         4. sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python-all-dev python3-all-dev && sudo pip install pyaudio
Run the program:
        1. python2 Dictionary_App.py


Future plan :
1. Making the program robust and an eye-catching GUI
2. Updating the word collection
